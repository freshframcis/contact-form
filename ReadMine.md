### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript for functionality

### What I learned

In the HTML part of the project, I learned the importance of using semantic tags to ensure proper functionality for screen readers. In CSS, I gained a deeper understanding of how Flexbox works and built the entire project using it, which significantly enhanced my experience and confidence in using Flexbox. Additionally, I successfully embedded JavaScript into the project to enable its functionality. Overall, this project has boosted my confidence in building frontend projects.

### Continued development

I still wish to develop in my use of javascript. And for that i will be picking more projects requiring javascript so as to enable me have a proper knowledge on how javascript functions
